# HandContoller

HandController targets to operate the hand to control the windows mouse pointing.
This program is made by μOS-Ⅲ which is created by [Micrium](https://www.micrium.com/).
Therefore, if you want to compile this program. You have to consist the μOS-Ⅲ project tree.
I highly recommend to check the `uCOS-III-Ex2`.
